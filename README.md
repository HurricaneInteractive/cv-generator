Website to generate a PDF Resume that is beautifully designed and easy to create. Here is a [link](https://goo.gl/umfPpW) to the current design prototype using Adobe XD.

### Technologies
The project is being built using primarly Laravel(PHP) and using a package called [Dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf). React(Javascript) will be used to create different textareas and inputs required to fill out the Resume fields, similar to [Medium](https://medium.com/).

### Scss & React
The project has been moved to use Laravel & React. Compiling assets such as Scss & Reactjs is done using the command `yarn run watch` or `npm run watch`. This will compile all assets and watch for additional changes.
